BUILD A CUSTOM THEME LAYOUR COMPONENT FOR LIGHTNING
  CREATE A COMMUNITY
    A custom theme layout componenet is the best way to construct the structure of a Lightning community template
      and override its defaults
    A theme layout component defines the top-level layout for the template pages 
    (1) in your Lightning community. It includes the common header and footer 
    (2), and often includes navigation, search, and the user profile menu.
    In contrast, the content layout (3) defines the content regions of your pages, such as a two-column layout.
      you can override a template's default structure by creating a custom Lightning componenet
      in Developer Console implementing ' forceCommunity:themeLayout ' interface
      to use custom Lightning components in your pages, u must assign component to a theme layout in Community Builder
        then apply the them layout in each page's properties

        //link below is pic showing template that includes a theme layout and it associated Lightning components

    Community Builder doesn't let you assign custom Lightning component directly to a page
     to instantly update structure of every page that a theme layout applies
     to simply by swapping Lightning component associated w/ theme layout
     //so that time isn't wasted updating every single page; allows quick refresh
