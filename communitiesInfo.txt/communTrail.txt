BUILD A CUSTOM THEME LAYOUR COMPONENT FOR LIGHTNING
  CREATE A COMMUNITY
    A custom theme layout componenet is the best way to construct the structure of a Lightning community template
      and override its defaults
    A theme layout component defines the top-level layout for the template pages 
    (1) in your Lightning community. It includes the common header and footer 
    (2), and often includes navigation, search, and the user profile menu.
    In contrast, the content layout (3) defines the content regions of your pages, such as a two-column layout.
      you can override a template's default structure by creating a custom Lightning componenet
      in Developer Console implementing ' forceCommunity:themeLayout ' interface
      to use custom Lightning components in your pages, u must assign component to a theme layout in Community Builder
        then apply the them layout in each page's properties

        //link below is pic showing template that includes a theme layout and it associated Lightning components

    Community Builder doesn't let you assign custom Lightning component directly to a page
     to instantly update structure of every page that a theme layout applies
     to simply by swapping Lightning component associated w/ theme layout
     //so that time isn't wasted updating every single page; allows quick refresh

  CREATE A CUSTOM THEME LAYOUT COMPONENT
    Define Theme Layout Component
     to appear in Community Builder in the Settings|Theme|Configure area, a theme layout component must implement
      forceCommunity:themeLayout inteface
    Add {!v.body} wherever you want the content, which changes from page to page, to appear within the theme layout component.
    Attributes declared as Aura.Component[] and included in your markup are rendered in the theme layout component as open regions, 
      which form the basic structure of your theme layout. Users can add drag-and-drop components to these regions in Community Builder.
    The code uses the SLDS grid system to add structure to the layout.

  ADD A DESIGN RESOURCE
    controls which component attr are exposed in Community Builder
    describes the design-time behavior of the Lightning component
      -infothat visual tools need to display the componenet in a page or app

  ADD A COMPANY LOGO
   Define a Tokens Bundle
   The tokens bundle extends forceCommunity:base, which gives access to all tokens exposed by SLDS 
    and the branding values defined in the Theme panel in Community Builder.
   
   Add a CSS Resource
    In Community Builder, each property in Theme panel maps to one or more standard design tokens. 
    by using tokens in CSS of component, easy to use the Theme panel to quickly update the component’s appearance.
    IN this case  we’re interested in the Company Logo property, which maps to the 'brandLogoImage' token.
    The code uses the brandLogoImage token (wrapped by a t()) 
      to inject the company logo in the CSS as the background image of the logoContainer.

  BUILD A VERTICAL NAV MENU
   Create and Test the Nav Component
    Extending forceCommunity:navigationMenuBase component gives new component automatic access 
     to all navigation menu items defined in the community’s Navigation Menu component. 
   Admins can define and update the items in the Navigation Menu in Community Builder.
   To show in action, the unordered list iterates through array of menuItems, 
    which is defined in the extended abstract component, 
    and outputs <li> for each entry in the array.

    This code takes advantage of aura expression syntax to do some nifty things. 
    You can conditionally add the slds-is-active class to the list item depending on whether the item is active. 
    You also set the data-menu-item-id to be the item’s unique ID, which you can use later to navigate to the corresponding item. 
    In this way, you need only one click listener for the entire list, instead of adding one for each list item.
    
    Code Highlight:
      Note the JavaScript syntax for accessing data attributes on HTML elements, which allows you to get that item’s ID.

    Add CSS to the Custom Theme Layout Component
      To get everything looking peachy, remove some unwanted margins from theme layout component 
        and set the main content width.
  BUILD A CUSTOM SEARCH COMPONENT
   Define a Custom Search Component 
     The customcode class uses a <lightning:ButtonIcon> component & includes a click handler
     It also includes an attribute called searchText to contain the search text and 
       uses a <ui:inputText> component (instead of <input>) to bind the values.

   Create an Apex Controller
    The searchForIds method takes a String searchText and returns a list of strings representing found IDs. 
    For now, we just return the search string itself.
    This code reads the value of the input text, sends it to the server-side Apex controller, and waits for a response. 
    If you test the example, you see an array logged to the browser console.
   
   Implement a Search Query w/ SOSL
     use SOSL in Apex class to create query that finds objects whose fields contain the input search text.

   Return the Search Results to a Custom Page
    this is how to take record IDs & redirect to new page containing record names & links to full record details. 
    To do this, you need:
     A Lightning component that displays a single record with a link to the record details
     A drag-and-drop component for Community Builder that lists the records
     A custom Community Builder page that uses the drag-and-drop component to show the returned records

   Create a Drag-and-Drop Component That Lists the Records
    Create a drag-and-drop component that appears in the Components panel in Community Builder. 
    When added to the custom page, it displays the list of returned records for the search term.
     Code Highlights:

     To appear in the Components panel in Community Builder, 
      a component must implement the forceCommunity:availableForAllPageTypes interface. 
     If you select the Lightning Communities Page checkbox when creating a new component, 
      the interface is automatically added to the default code.
     Mark your resources, such as a component, with access="global" to make the resource usable outside of your own org. 
     For example, if you want a component to be usable in an installed package or 
      by a Lightning App Builder user or a Community Builder user in another org.

  ADD CONFIGURATION PROPERTIES TO THE THEME LAYOUT
   you add a property to the theme layout component, 
    which lets you hide the search component completely in Community Builder.
